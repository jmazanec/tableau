## Analysis of the Citi Bike Data for Summer from 2019 to 2020

Through this project and data I have shown the differences between riding schedule, total rides, and total usage of Citibike.

The period of analysis is from June 2019-August 2019 and having that compared to June 2020-August 2020 to have a similar timeframe.

Through Tableau, I ran the data to get the number of rides by the hour of the day and rides by the time of the day by the day of the week. These were conclusive of the paradigm shift that was the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic made less people take the bikes early in the morning for work rush hour and more people were taking the bikes on the weekends. 

Then, I ran the number of total rides per year and then broke it down by month. This showed a result of drops in rides from 2019 to 2020, which was expected. However, when I drilled down in to month, it showed that the months did not really change except for June when the pandemic was still young. I would conclude that because the pandemic was new, people did not really know what they could and could not do. As people got more comfortable in "the new normal", people were more adventurous and trying bikes to ease anxiety. 

Finally, the duration of rides went up. I thought this would just be because of weekends, but it was overall up. The conclusion I would say that this was because Citibike would be one of the safest ways for people to get around the city without coming in close contact with others inside of a closed space.
